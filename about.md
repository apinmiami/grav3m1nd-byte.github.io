## Hi everyone!



## Who am I:

  I am a Security Engineer in the US East Coast with nearly 10 years in the industry. Through my career, I had performed Security Control and Vulnerability Assessments for public and private sectors. I love learning new things every day which lead me into the path of wanting to learn about Penetration Testing and Python; self-learner and multi-tasker by nature. At the moment, Hack The Box is a platform I use to further practice what I learn from Penetration Testing trainings I'm currently taking such as eJPT, which will be followed by eCPPT, and hopefully OSCP by the end of the year.

  I also enjoy building new solutions for organizations while setting up the standard on how systems should be built from the ground up and securely.
