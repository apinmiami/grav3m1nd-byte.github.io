## Purpose of this site:

  This site is meant to help people by sharing the paths I take on Hack the Box Machines I had completed. If anything I can be reached in the forum, DMs in Hack The Box or Discord. 

  As members are not supposed to release any write up while machines or challenges are stil Active, I will be updating the content as the machines start to get retired.

  Something I want everyone to keep in mind, what you will go through here is my path to Root the machine or to complete the challenge, not necessarily the only way or the best way. As we are humans, we all can make mistakes or end up going down rabbitholes. In some cases, I will still show some of the mistakes I've done and flag them.

## My advice to you all!

1. Through your learning process, be patient and try not to get frustrated, but if you do, step out for a little bit.
2. Try to enjoy the process.
3. Go to the forum, go to Discord, contact other members that had rooted or completed the boxes. There is a lot of people wiliing to help.
