## Hi everyone!


### Who am I:

  I am a Security Engineer in the US East Coast with nearly 10 years in the industry. Through my career, I had performed Security Control and Vulnerability Assessments for public and private sectors. I love learning new things every day which lead me into the path of wanting to learn about Penetration Testing and Python; self-learner and multi-tasker by nature. At the moment, Hack The Box is a platform I use to further practice what I learn from Penetration Testing trainings I'm currently taking such as eJPT, which will be followed by eCPPT, and hopefully OSCP by the end of the year.

  I also enjoy building new solutions for organizations while setting up the standard on how systems should be built from the ground up and securely.




### Purpose of this site:

  This site is meant to help people by sharing the paths I take on Hack the Box Machines I had completed. If anything I can be reached in the forum, DMs in Hack The Box or Discord. 

  As members are not supposed to release any write up while machines or challenges are stil Active, I will be updating the content as the machines start to get retired.

  Something I want everyone to keep in mind, what you will go through here is my path to Root the machine or to complete the challenge, not necessarily the only way or the best way. As we are humans, we all can make mistakes or end up going down rabbitholes. In some cases, I will still show some of the mistakes I've done and flag them.

### My advice to you all!

1. Through your learning process, be patient and try not to get frustrated, but if you do, step out for a little bit.
2. Try to enjoy the process.
3. Go to the forum, go to Discord, contact other members that had rooted or completed the boxes. There is a lot of people wiliing to help.
