# [Grav3m1ndbyte's Resources Blog](index.md): Hack The Box Retired Machines Walkthroughs


![Grav3m1ndbyte HTB Badge](https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/75471)




  As Hack The Box members are not supposed to release any write up or walkthrough while machines or challenges are stil Active, I will be updating the content as the machines start to get retired.

  At the moment, I don't have much here as the rest of my walkthroughs are from machines that are still active. If my assistance is needed, refer to my [Contact Me](/contact.md) page and feel free to do so.




##  Machines
### 1. [Postman](Postman/postman.md)




## My advice to you all!

1. Through your learning process, be patient and try not to get frustrated, but if you do, step out for a little bit.
2. Try to enjoy the process.
3. Go to the forum, go to Discord, contact other members that had rooted or completed the boxes. There is a lot of people wiliing to help.
